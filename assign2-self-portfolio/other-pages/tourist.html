        <h2>Blue mosque (Istanbul)</h2>
        <p>
          The Blue Mosque in Istanbul, also known by its official name, the
          Sultan Ahmed Mosque (Turkish: Sultan Ahmet Camii), is an Ottoman-era
          historical imperial mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey. A functioning
          mosque, it also attracts large numbers of tourist visitors. It was
          constructed between 1609 and 1616 during the rule of Ahmed I. Its
          Külliye contains Ahmed's tomb, a madrasah and a hospice. Hand-painted
          blue tiles adorn the mosque's interior walls, and at night the mosque
          is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque's five main domes, six
          minarets and eight secondary domes.

        <h2>Niagara Falls (Canada Border)</h2>
        <p>
          Niagara Falls (/naɪˈæɡərə/) is a group of three waterfalls at the
          southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the border between the
          province of Ontario in Canada and the state of New York in the United
          States. The largest of the three is Horseshoe Falls, which straddles
          the international border of the two countries. It is also known as the
          Canadian Falls. The smaller American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie
          within the United States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from
          Horseshoe Falls by Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island,
          with both islands situated in New York.
